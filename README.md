WHAT MATTERS MOST
A decision making app to help you prioritize what matters most in life

AUDIENCE
This free and open-source app is for anyone who has to make any big decision in life and needs help understanding what criteria are the most important to them, for the given decision.

SUMMARY
Users can enter a topic that desribes a current decision they have to make (i.e. 'Where to live', 'What job to take', 'Which apartment to rent' or more basically 'What is most important to me in life?')

Next, the user will input 2-7 criteria they are considering to use to make that decision. If the topic was 'Choosing a job' the criteria might be:
   * salary
   * opportunities for growth
   * company reputation
   * culture / values alignment
   * paid time off

The criteria will be shuffled, randomized, and displayed in pairs forcing the user to choose between one or the other. The algorithim continues to shuffle through all possible combinations. Each time the user clicks on an option, that option receives one 'vote' and a score is incremented accordingly.

At the end, the user is presented with the criteria that matters most to them, as well as the complete listing of all the criteria, their rank (according to total score), and the cumulative score.

Optionally, users can choose to submit their annoymized data to be used for future analysis to help other users better understand what matters most to all of us.

PROBLEM
This app helps to alleviate decision fatigue and paralysis by analysis for people who have to make big decisions in life.

SOLUTION
By comparing each option to each other, users are forced to prioritize what matters most in a more objective manner and help them clarify what matters most, alleviating a lot of the stress that comes with making big decisions.

"The best decision you can make, is any decision that moves you forward."

"I wasn't sure what job to take. The one with the high salary but the monotonous day to day work. Or the one with the flexible schedule and more interesting work, but less opportunity to growth. Thanks to this app, now I know. And I LOVE my new job!" - Satisfied Customer (2021)

DON'T WAIT, DECIDE
Researchers have found that most of the stress related to life's big moments comes from inability to make a decision. You don't have to suffer, just figure out what matters most to you and decide.
